==========================================

Microgame Mod 01 Info

Added a steep jump ramp from Ballin Seagulls (roadRampHigh) to replace the standard jump ramp. They allow more speed and height,
but are a lot smaller in return.
Changed the checkpoint sound to Vine Boom.
Changed the victory sound to a referee's whistle signaling the end of a game.
Changed the main racing music to Ska Cha Cha by Hideki Naganuma from the Sonic Rush OST.

and the only other person who is going to see this is you, Professor Taylor. also, this song is just good and fits the racing + vaporwave
aesthetic too well.)
